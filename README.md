# ü§ñ BOT VISITOR PROXY

Bot visitor is used (GET HTTP) to send traffic to the target web/blog where this bot uses a proxy to determine different IP addresses.

This bot uses 1000 user-agents which can send to different types of devices used, to avoid spam detection on the target website. So you don't need to bother adding a user-agent, you only need to add the Proxy and Host Referers that you want to use. 

Don't use Host Referrers for pornography, gambling, or anything else. Because it can cause the targeted website/blog to become non-indexed by Google

## ‚öíÔ∏è Command Management Access

The following is cmd management in bot :

| CMD       | Information |
|-----------|-------------|
| /send_visitor `url` `bot` `delay`    | example : `/send_visitor https://websitetarget.com 100 5` |
| /stop_visitor     | stop process bot |
| /getproxy     | viewing proxy list |
| /setproxy `ip:port`    | adding new proxy |
| /removeproxy `ip:port`    | remove proxy |
| /getreferers     | view referers list |

## üì¢ Information

It should be noted that this bot must use a `Proxy (HTTP).` If it doesn't use a proxy, this bot will `NOT` be able to run. I suggest using `20-50 Residental Proxy (HTTP)` for Socks5 or others I haven't tried, you can try it yourself.

I dedicate it to people who are tired of waiting for a long time to index their website/blog, maybe this will help a little. I am not responsible if someone abuses this script to send traffic continuously without stopping, because it can cause non-indexing, aka the loss of the web/blog index from Google. 

`Use as necessary, take your own risk!`
